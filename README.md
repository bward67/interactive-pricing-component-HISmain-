Loved this challenge but I could not have completed the slider, the toggle btn and some of the JS without this mans help

Super clever how he used a linear gradient to get the slider to change color as it moves left and right and how he modified a checkbox for the toggle button. I just hope I can remember these when I need them again :)!
